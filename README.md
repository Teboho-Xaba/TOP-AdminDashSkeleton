# TOP-AdminDashSkeleton

Before I attempt to build the Admin Dashboard as per The Odin Project's CSS Grid project
I first want to do a skeletal layour plan so as to see how I can best approach this project
before I even watch any YouTube tutorial which I'll just be following along without really learning
anything.
The progress on this project is very basic and minimum. nothing to beat the drum about.

Tools used:
HTML and CSS

Positives:

- using grid-template-areas well
- using grid-area and grid-position
- figuring out what heights and widths were best for the layout

Negatives:

- couldn't figure out how to align the "sidebar" divs along the main section
- unsure about the sizes to use for each of the three main sections

Main takeaway:
Inconsistency is ruining my progress.
Repetition should remedy the lack of proficiency in skill
Not close to being a Frontend Developer
